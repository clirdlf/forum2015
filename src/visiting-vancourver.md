_This compendium of useful information is brought to you by local planning committee members Mark Jordan, Mimi Lam, Larissa Ringham, Shirley Lew, Tara Robertson, and Paul Joseph._

### How do I get to the hotel?

Vancouver’s rapid rail system is called SkyTrain, and its newest line, the Canada Line, will take you from Vancouver International Airport to the Pinnacle Hotel Vancouver Harbourfront. Just find platform sign “Canada Line to Waterfront” and take that route to Waterfront Station. From Waterfront Station, the hotel is a 7-minute walk down West Hastings Street, or a 3-minute taxi ride. [View these directions in Google Maps.](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Vancouver+International+Airport,+Grant+McConachie+Way,+Richmond,+BC,+Canada/Pinnacle+Hotel+Harbourfront,+Vancouver,+1133+West+Hastings+Street,+Vancouver,+BC+V6E+3T3,+Canada/@49.2408581,-123.2179609,12z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x54860b348627a39b:0xba68ccac86348084!2m2!1d-123.1815123!2d49.1966913!1m5!1m1!1s0x54867183ede22563:0x6760951648061853!2m2!1d-123.1207105!2d49.2884814!3e3)

### What will the weather be like?

We can expect temperatures in the 40s and 50s fahrenheit/5-13 degrees celsius. Vancouver has rain about half the days in the month of October. You will probably want to bring rain gear or an umbrella, your favorite cardigan, and a jacket.
