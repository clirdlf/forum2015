New in 2015, DLF has created a framework for establishing mentoring relationships among our community members. The program is centered around face-to-face interaction at the Forum. We’re thrilled to say that **more than 20% of our Vancouver attendees** answered yes to the following questions and chose to participate in the program!

_Are you willing to share your expertise and help grow the profession as a mentor? Are you willing to “pay it forward” and help someone else benefit from your experience?_

_Do you feel like you could benefit from some guidance on how to grow your career? Would you like to have a conversation in a trusted environment with a neutral party that has expertise to offer you?_

DLF does the matching, and mentors agree to:

*   Exchange emails with mentees before the conference
*   Meet up for a mentor/mentee lunch
*   Offer advice and general guidance
*   Maintain confidentiality as requested

If you missed the opportunity this year, be sure to sign up to be a mentor or mentee during registration for the [2016 Forum in Milwaukee](https://forum2016.diglib.org)!
