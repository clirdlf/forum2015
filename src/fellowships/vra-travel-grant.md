The [Visual Resources Association](https://vraweb.org/) (VRA) and the DLF are pleased to support a Cross-Pollinator Travel Grant for the DLF Forum in Vancouver, British Columbia from October 26–28.

The goal of the VRA + DLF Cross-Pollinator Travel Grant is to bring a cross-pollinator—a visual resources professional working in a library, archive, museum, or academic setting who can provide a unique perspective with DLF and share a vision of the digital library world from their perspective—to the conference. The grant recipient can envision and articulate a connection with their work and sees great value in building a dynamic and diverse peer network.

The Cross-Pollinator Travel Grant is a reciprocal program between the DLF and VRA. The program will also bring a digital library practitioner who typically attends the DLF Forum to the [2016 ARLIS/NA + VRA Conference](http://www.arlisna-vra.org/seattle2016/index.php) in Seattle, March 8–12.

We are pleased to welcome this year’s VRA + DLF Cross-Pollinator Fellow, Andrea Schuler!
