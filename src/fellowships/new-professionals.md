The DLF community welcomes newcomers to the profession and new voices at its annual [DLF Forum]({{ '/' | url }}). To further this aim, we continue to provide DLF Forum Fellowships for Students and New Professionals to attend the 2015 DLF Forum in Vancouver, British Columbia from October 26–28.

The DLF community includes staff who work in cultural heritage organizations who are lively, intellectually engaged, and inquisitive, but who are not always routinely funded to travel to conferences where they can learn more about the library profession, see digital initiatives from other institutions, and meet leaders in the profession. The Forum is an excellent place to hear about the latest advances in digital librarianship, to meet new colleagues and contacts, and to get involved with DLF initiatives.

We are very happy to welcome the 2015 DLF Forum Students and New Professionals Fellows!

### The Award

Four awards of up to $1,250 each to go towards the travel, board, and lodging expenses of attending the DLF Forum. Additionally, the fellows will each receive a complimentary full registration to the Forum ($475). Fellowship recipients will be required to write a blog post, subsequent to the Forum, about their experience; this blog post will be published by DLF.

###  Eligibility

Applicants and nominations must come from a current [**DLF member institution**](https://www.diglib.org/members/). The following full- or part-time individuals are eligible:

*   Faculty, librarians, or staff members at DLF member institutions who have been in the profession for 3 years or less; and whose work is wholly or predominantly in some area of the digital library or digital scholarship.
*   Graduate and undergraduate students at DLF member institutions who, although only working part-time, make a significant contribution to a digital library endeavor and who may be considering a career in digital libraries or digital scholarship.

### Application

Applications were due by 4:00pm EDT on **Friday, May 22, 2015**. Using the email subject line “New Professionals Fellowship: \[Your Name\]” attach one document containing the following items:

*   Cover letter of nomination from the candidate’s supervisor/manager or a library executive.
*   Personal statement from the candidate (ca. 500 words) explaining their educational background, what their digital library involvement is, why they are excited about digital library work, and how they see themselves benefiting from the DLF Forum.
*   A current résumé.

###  Evaluation

Candidates were selected by the Forum Program Planning Committee. In assessing the applications, the Committee looked for a demonstrated commitment to digital library work as evidenced by work experience and academic background, and considered the degree to which forum participation might influence the applicant’s decision to pursue a digital library career. They made sure that the applicants met the basic eligibility requirements.

The winning applicants must be able to travel to Vancouver, British Columbia from October 26–28.
