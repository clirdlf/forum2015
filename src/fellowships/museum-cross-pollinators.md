For the second year, the [Samuel H. Kress Foundation](https://www.kressfoundation.org/) and the DLF are supporting fellowships for practicing museum professionals seeking more exposure on the trends in digital libraries. The DLF community is always looking for ways to expand the conversation around digital collections and related activities and include new perspectives at the Forum.

The goal of these fellowships is to bring cross-pollinators—museum professionals who can provide unique perspectives to our work and share a vision of the cultural heritage world from their perspective—to the conference. In our increasingly networked world, we hope to increase communication between all groups interested in the future of digital resources, including museums, libraries, colleges and universities, and anyone working in the realm of digital collections and services.

A very warm welcome to our 2015 DLF Forum Museum Cross-Pollinators!
