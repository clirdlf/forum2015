title: ARL + DLF Forum Fellows from Underrepresented Groups
layout: presentation
---

In 2010, the Digital Library Federation made a positive change and commitment to being an open organization, welcoming members from all parts of the digital library community, soliciting contributions to the annual Forum from members and non members alike, and making every effort to connect conversations that extend beyond our organizational borders. Our community grew as a result, and our Forums have been enriched with new voices and perspectives that yield a more dynamic and exciting event.

The DLF Forum is fairly gender-balanced both for speakers and attendees. We see limited representation from a number of communities, however, and seek to increase participant diversity. To this end, we continue to offer our ARL + DLF Forum Fellowships for Underrepresented Groups (established 2013), for the 2015 Forum in Vancouver, British Columbia.

These fellows are part of or were nominated by a current [DLF member institution](http://www.diglib.org/members/), or otherwise identify their institutions as community colleges, historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs), tribal colleges or universities (TCUs), or state, local, or regional tribal governments. Fellows are interested in actively contributing to the DLF Forum and are part of a traditionally underrepresented group including, but not limited to, people of Hispanic or Latino, Black or African-American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or American Indian or Alaskan Native descent.

A warm welcome our 2015 ARL + DLF Fellows from Underrepresented Groups!

Up to four fellowships will be awarded, each up to $1,250, to be applied towards travel, board, and lodging expenses associated with attending a DLF Forum. Additionally, the fellows will each receive a complimentary full registration to the Forum ($475). Fellowship recipients will be required to write a blog post about their experience, subsequent to the Forum; this blog post will be published by DLF.
