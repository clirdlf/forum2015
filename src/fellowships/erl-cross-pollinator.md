[Electronic Resources and Libraries](http://www.electroniclibrarian.com/) (ER&L) and DLF are pleased to announce the recipients of two travel grants to the 2015 DLF Forum in Vancouver, BC.

The purpose of these grants is to extend the opportunity to attend the DLF Forum to two library professionals who would not typically be able to go, but who can envision and articulate a connection with their ER&L-related work and who see great value in building a dynamic and diverse peer network. The cross-pollinator grants are also part of an ongoing effort to explore connections between these two communities. In turn, DLF and ER&L will come together to support DLF community members in attending the [ER&L 2016 conference](http://electroniclibrarian.org/conference-info/) from April 3–6 in Austin, Texas.

We are pleased to announce the 2015 DLF + ER&L Cross-Pollinator Travel Award Fellows!
