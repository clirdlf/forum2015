The Community Idea Exchange is made up of Posters and a Lightning Round. Fast-paced and fun, the Lightning Round gives each presenter one minute to pitch their poster to the conference audience. There is also dedicated time in the program for attendees to visit with poster presenters.

The CIE will be part of the evening reception on Monday, October 27, 5:15-8:00 pm. The Lightning Round will start at 5:30. Like last year, attendees can vote for their favorite poster. The winning poster presenter gets a 2015 DLF Forum registration, and a voter is randomly selected to also win 2015 registration.

**Winning poster:** The winner of attendees’ favorite poster was [**Expanding Conventional Collection Boundaries Through Visualization**]({{ '/assets/Expanding-Conventional-Collection-Boundaries-Through-Visualization.pdf' | url }}).
