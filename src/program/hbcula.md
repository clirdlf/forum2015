**Session Description**  
The HBCU Library Alliance was established in 2002 by library deans and directors of White House-designated Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and is the only membership organization to exclusively serve HBCU libraries. For more than ten years, this organization has successfully provided an array of resources designed to support HBCU libraries and their constituents. With funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the HBCU Library Alliance has strengthened member institutions through programs including leadership development, photographic preservation and digital services.

This presentation will describe the vibrant history and accomplishments of HBCU Library Alliance programs with an emphasis on the Alliance’s Digital Initiative.
