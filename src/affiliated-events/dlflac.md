The Digital Library Federation is hosting our first annual **DLF Liberal Arts Colleges Preconference** on October 25th in Vancouver, Canada, preceding this year’s [DLF Forum]({{ '/' | url }}).

This will be a one day meeting specifically created for those who work with digital libraries and/or digital scholarship at liberal arts colleges. The event is designed to foster conversation and build community, both formally and informally. Participants do not need to be members of DLF.

An opening keynote and closing panel will bookend the day and frame conversations. The keynote will be jointly presented by Cecily Walker, Assistant Manager for Community Digital Initiatives & eLearning at Vancouver Public Library, and Chris Bourg, Ph.D., Director of Libraries at MIT. The closing panel, “Lead, Follow, or Listen,” will consider how liberal arts colleges can best contribute to ongoing discussions and activities in the digital library world. The panel will be interactive, and include administrator, library director, and digital librarian perspectives. Bethany Nowviskie, Director of the Digital Library Federation, will be the emcee.

The preconference will also include concurrent sessions of presentations and panels on pedagogical, organizational, and technological approaches to the digital humanities and digital scholarship, data curation, digital collections, and digital preservation. Presenters represent many regions and institution sizes, reflecting the strength and variety of the liberal arts community.
