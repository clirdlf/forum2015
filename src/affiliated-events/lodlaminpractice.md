Linked Open Data in libraries, archives and museums (“LODLAM”) continues to be a fast growing area of policy and technology having a major impact on the way memory institutions are opening the doors to new kinds of research, discovery and access.

This day-long training workshop will equip you with the knowledge and tools to engage in your own LODLAM projects. Expert practitioners will demonstrate real-world examples, teach open source tools, and give hands-on instruction. Tutorials will cover a range of skill sets moving from novice to advanced as the day goes on. You’ll learn the basics of cleaning, publishing, and linking metadata as well as querying, consuming, and connecting datasets. We’ll also cover data collection visualizations and building more advanced queries. Throughout the day, there will be ample opportunity to make connections and dig deeper into the topics introduced here.
