[Islandora](https://islandora.ca/) is a digital repository framework that provides out-of-the-box repository solutions (Solution Packs) for a wide range of digital collections and research domains. Islandora combines the Drupal CMS and Fedora Commons repository software, together with additional open source applications (including Solr), to deliver a wide range of functionality. The workshop will give participants a chance to explore how community members are using Islandora, and how to:

*   Change the look and feel of a repository website;
*   Create users, roles and permissions to manage workflow;
*   Ingest and manage digital assets;
*   Harvest assets to aggregators such as DPLA;
*   Restrict access to digital assets; and  
*   Configure the discovery layer and metadata display tools.

Registration for this event is $80 USD and includes refreshments and lunch. We look forward to seeing you there.
