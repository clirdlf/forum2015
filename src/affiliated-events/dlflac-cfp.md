⇒ **The Call for Proposals is now closed. The program will be announced in August.** ⇐

This year’s [DLF Forum]({{ '/' | url }}) in Vancouver, BC will include a one-day preconference specifically for liberal arts colleges, to be held on October 25.

The preconference will be an opportunity for those of us working with digital libraries/digital scholarship in liberal arts colleges to work closely together, in the spirit of the liberal arts seminar, to consider the issues and opportunities unique to us. We invite proposals for panels, presentations, or working sessions that foster conversation, connections, and provocation at the intersection of digital libraries and the liberal arts. How does your project or approach take advantage of the liberal arts environment, or respond to its limitations? How is your work informed by the values of a liberal arts college? What is the role of liberal arts college institutions in the digital library/digital scholarship world?

### Session Types

*   **Full Panel:** Multiple presenters centered on a theme, in the format of your choice. (60 minutes)
*   **Presentation:** Single or multiple presenters, covering specific topics or case studies. (20 minutes)
*   **Working session:** An interactive session involving hands-on learning and collaboration. Single or multiple presenters. (30 minutes or 60 minutes)
