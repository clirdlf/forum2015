## Travel

Vancouver’s rapid rail system is called SkyTrain, and its newest line, the Canada Line, will take you from Vancouver International Airport to the Pinnacle Hotel Vancouver Harbourfront. Just find platform sign “Canada Line to Waterfront” and take that route to Waterfront Station. From Waterfront Station, the hotel is a a quick walk or taxi ride (750 meters). Because of a running race on 10/24 and 10/25, we suggest taking Pender Street from the Waterfront Station to the hotel ([view on Google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/S5vGAXJ6FYo)), to avoid traffic and road closures. If you arrive after mid-day Sunday, you should not be affected by the races and can walk down West Hastings to the hotel. [View directions from the airport to the hotel on Google Maps.](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Vancouver+International+Airport,+Grant+McConachie+Way,+Richmond,+BC,+Canada/Pinnacle+Hotel+Harbourfront,+Vancouver,+1133+West+Hastings+Street,+Vancouver,+BC+V6E+3T3,+Canada/@49.2408581,-123.2179609,12z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x54860b348627a39b:0xba68ccac86348084!2m2!1d-123.1815123!2d49.1966913!1m5!1m1!1s0x54867183ede22563:0x6760951648061853!2m2!1d-123.1207105!2d49.2884814!3e3)
